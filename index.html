    <p>Aesthetic Style’s Victorian Roots
While the term aesthetic has new meanings today, it first started as a movement in Victorian times.
 In the 1800s, the Aesthetic Movement was a push for art for art’s sake in Britain.
    </br>
</br>
  It was a movement that pushed against the utilitarian design of the Industrial Age, instead creating art, jewelry and other works that were focused on beauty above all else. 
  In the vintage jewelry world, aesthetic jewelry is about antique pieces from the time of the British Aesthetic Movement from around 1860-1900. 
Vintage aesthetic jewelry was focused on quality craftspersonship and beautiful designs. </p>
